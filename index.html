        <p>Hi, my name is Josef. I am a senior and an accounting major. I think I would like to do taxes for my career. I really enjoyed the two tax classes that I took from the university. I’ve wanted to be an accountant after doing a middle school project where we had to job shadow someone.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, spikeball, and golf. I’ve been playing soccer and golf since I was 12 and I am pretty new to spikeball. I’m not crazy good at these sports but I have fun.
            My family currently lives in Wyoming, but I spent most of my time in Louisiana as a kid. </p>
